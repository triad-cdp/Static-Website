                <p class="blue_bodytext">
                    Over time businesses have invested significantly in their IT estate often without recognising
                    the true value that the existing infrastructure is capable of delivering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    AJLoman specialises in helping you to drive greater value from this investment and exploiting it still
                    further to enable complex transformation and transition programmes. Our commitment to you is to
                    radically improve the efficiencies of IT, while reducing your cost to serve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    IT is a latecomer to the concepts of lean and continuous improvement and, historically, this has
                    driven the unrelenting investment in new infrastructure, services and headcount.
                </p>

                <p>
                    IT has never been challenged as heavily as it is today to join the Lean Revolution. Our approach
                    is always to re-use and rejuvenate, before buying or building again.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class=column-2>
                <p class="orange_title">Business Benefits</p>

                <img class="column-image" src="images/business-benefits.jpg" alt="business-benefits"/>

                <p>
                    The IT function only exists to enable a business to achieve its corporate objectives
                    in a cost effective way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    AJLoman will help you focus on your key business goals to deliver the right level of IT capability to
                    achieve these benefits successfully and within the required timeframe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Delivering to a focused, defined set of requirements is quicker and more cost effective than
                    over-scoping, unnecessary feature-rich solutions.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class=column-3>
                <p class=orange_title>IT Benefits</p>

                <p>
                    Adopting the AJLoman Lean Architecture Operating Model, enables IT teams to provide a business
                    value-focused service to their organisation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We provide the model, the energy, change management, and the environment to alter the mindset, but it is
                    your own IT team that going forward can utilise this new approach for the future needs of the business
                    and improve the value they deliver beyond all recognition.
                </p>

                    <p class=orange_bodytext>
                        Our ethos is to attack all ways in which money leaks from a business via IT and to reduce its
                        effect.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We help you to judge when to spend and on what, leaving aside the preferences, prejudices and skill
                        sets of those who are involved in IT projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We find the right blend of acquisition spend and ongoing affordability, without bias, to reduce your
                        Total Cost of Ownership.
